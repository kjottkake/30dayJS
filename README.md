# 30dayJS
This is the 30 day Javascript challenge. Where I tackle a new Javascript project each day for 30 days. Here I am going to detail the challenges and obstacles I had to face along each project, and what I learned from each project.

# Day 1 Drum Kit
<b>What is it?</b>

I made a html drum set where you can play different drum sounds based on keystrokes. 

<b> What I learned?</b>

I learned about querySelectors and the keyCode method.

<b> Future Improvements</b>

I will need to add in animations for the feedback of the keys.

# Day 2 Analog Clock 
<b> What is it?</b>

I made an analog clock which displays the current time. 

<b> What I learned?</b>

You can transform individual style of elements with Javascript selectors.

<b> Future Improvements</b>

As of right now there is currently a bug which makes the secondHand glitch for a split second before resetting at 12 O 'clock when passing the 12 O' clock position. This is due to the animation calculations resetting improperly. There is a fix for this in the tutorials however it's a fairly hacky fix. 

# Day 3 Css Adjustment Bars

# Day 4 Array Cardio Day 1

# Day 5 Flex Panel Gallery
<b> What is it?</b>

This is practicing various flex details and some simple flex animations.

<b> What I learned?</b>


<b> Future Improvements</b>

Some more cooler animations and my version of this particular project.

# Day 6 Type Ahead
<b> What is it?</b>

This makes a simple call to an endpoint which returns some json data. The user is able to get some data based on the city.

<b> What I learned?</b>

es6 Spread functions. This is the first time I used console.table() as well, super useful.

<b> Future Improvements</b>

Will have to implement this in my own project calling on some API, perhaps a weather app.

# Day 7 Array Cardio Day 2
<b> What is it?</b>
<b> What I learned?</b>
<b> Future Improvements</b>

# Day 8 HTML5 Canvas
<b> What is it?</b>

A simple drawing board. This is a simple implementation of the HTML 5 Canvas.

<b> What I learned?</b>

ctx refers to the context or what is being drawing on. It was nice to see this concept used in web browsers and drawing on a 2d canvas. 3D canvases are also an option with html.

<b> Future Improvements</b>

More colors and functionalities.

# Day 9 Dev Tools
