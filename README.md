# 30dayJS
This is the 30 day Javascript challenge. Where I tackle a new Javascript project each day for 30 days. Here I am going to detail the challenges and obstacles I had to face along each project, and what I learned from each project.

# Day 1 Drum Kit
## What is it?
I made a html drum set where you can play different drum sounds based on keystrokes. 

## What I learned?
I learned about querySelectors and the keyCode method.

## Future Improvements
I will need to add in animations for the feedback of the keys.

# Day 2 Analog Clock 
## What is it?
I made an analog clock which displays the current time. 

## What I learned?
You can transform individual style of elements with Javascript selectors.

## Future Improvements
As of right now there is currently a bug which makes the secondHand glitch for a split second before resetting at 12 O 'clock when passing the 12 O' clock position. This is due to the animation calculations resetting improperly.
