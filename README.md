# 30dayJS
This is the 30 day Javascript challenge. Where I tackle a new Javascript project each day for 30 days. Here I am going to detail the challenges and obstacles I had to face along each project, and what I learned from each project.

# Day 1 Drum Kit
<b>What is it?</b>
I made a html drum set where you can play different drum sounds based on keystrokes. 

<b> What I learned?</b>
I learned about querySelectors and the keyCode method.

<b> Future Improvements</b>
I will need to add in animations for the feedback of the keys.

# Day 2 Analog Clock 
<b> What is it?</b>
I made an analog clock which displays the current time. 

<b> What I learned?</b>
You can transform individual style of elements with Javascript selectors.

<b> Future Improvements</b>
As of right now there is currently a bug which makes the secondHand glitch for a split second before resetting at 12 O 'clock when passing the 12 O' clock position. This is due to the animation calculations resetting improperly. There is a fix for this in the tutorials however it's a fairly hacky fix.
